This file implements the truncate_length script for the YT_DIFF model.

The truncate_length script provides functionality to process and truncate audio files 
that exceed a specified maximum duration. Here are the key steps:

1. Configuration:
   - Takes input folder path containing audio files
   - Specifies backup folder for original files
   - Sets maximum duration limit (300 seconds)

2. File Processing:
   - Recursively walks through input directory
   - Identifies FLAC audio files
   - Checks duration using torchaudio
   - Skips files under max duration
   - Skips already processed files (with _trnk suffix)

3. Audio Truncation:
   - Uses ffmpeg to truncate files exceeding max length
   - Preserves original audio format and metadata
   - Creates new truncated file with _trnk suffix
   - Original file can be backed up if backup path provided

4. Error Handling:
   - Validates directory existence
   - Catches and logs audio info retrieval errors
   - Handles ffmpeg processing errors
   - Skips problematic files gracefully

5. Output:
   - Truncated files saved alongside originals
   - Original files optionally backed up
   - Processing status logged to console
