"""
This file implements the training pipeline for the YT_DIFF model.

Key functionality:
- Provides command line interface for training with required arguments:
  - model_path: Path to either load a pretrained model or create a new one
  - train_config_path: Path to JSON configuration file with training parameters

- Initializes environment for GPU training (mac only)

- Loads training configuration from JSON into YT_DIFFTrainerConfig object
  which contains all hyperparameters and settings for training

- Creates YT_DIFFTrainer instance that handles:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Model initialization/loading
  - Training loop implementation
  - Checkpointing
  - Logging and metrics tracking
  - Validation

- Executes training loop via trainer.train() which:
  - Iterates through epochs/batches
  - Computes losses
  - Updates model weights
  - Logs progress
  - Saves checkpoints
  - Performs validation

The training process combines VAE and EDM2 approaches in a hybrid architecture
for high-quality audio generation.
