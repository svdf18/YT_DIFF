"""
This file contains the implementation of the YT_DIFFDataset class for loading and preprocessing audio data.

The key components are:

1. Dataset Configuration:
   - DatasetConfig dataclass defines parameters like sample rate, channels, crop widths
   - Controls whether to use pre-encoded latents and embeddings
   - Configures data and cache directories

2. Data Transformation:
   - DatasetTransform class handles preprocessing of audio samples
   - Applies cropping, resampling, and normalization
   - Manages time scaling for diffusion process

3. Data Loading:
   - Loads audio files and associated metadata
   - Can use pre-encoded latents/embeddings from cache
   - Handles filtering of invalid samples

4. Processing Pipeline:
   - Converts raw audio to model-ready format
   - Manages caching of processed data
   - Applies transformations efficiently
