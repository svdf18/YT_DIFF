This file implements the VAE trainer class for the dual diffusion model.

The training process for the VAE follows these key steps:
1. Initialization:
   - Sets up VAE model configuration and parameters
   - Initializes loss functions and weights
   - Configures spectral loss with block sizes and overlap
   - Prepares target SNR and noise levels
   - Sets up model compilation if enabled

2. Input Processing:
   - Takes batches of audio data as input
   - Handles data formatting and device placement
   - Applies any necessary preprocessing
   - Manages batch dimensions and shapes

3. Forward Pass:
   - Encodes input data into latent space
   - Applies variational sampling in latent space
   - Decodes latents back to audio domain
   - Handles real and imaginary components

4. Loss Computation:
   - Calculates reconstruction loss in time domain
   - Computes KL divergence on channel dimensions
   - Applies spectral losses across multiple scales
   - Weights different loss components:
     * Channel KL loss (weight=0.1)
     * Imaginary component loss (weight=0.1) 
     * Point-wise loss (weight=0)
     * Reconstruction loss (weight=0.1)

5. Optimization:
   - Accumulates gradients from loss components
   - Updates VAE model parameters
   - Applies learning rate scheduling
   - Handles gradient clipping if configured

6. Validation:
   - Evaluates reconstruction quality
   - Computes validation metrics
   - Generates sample reconstructions
   - Tracks best performing checkpoints

7. Monitoring:
   - Logs training metrics and loss values
   - Records reconstruction quality metrics
   - Exports validation samples
   - Tracks training progress
