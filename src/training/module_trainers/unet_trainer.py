This file implements the UNet trainer class for the YT_DIFF model.

The training process for the UNet follows these key steps:
1. Initialization:
   - Sets up sigma sampling configurations for training and validation
   - Initializes optimizers and learning rate schedules
   - Prepares loss tracking and metrics

2. Input Processing:
   - Loads batches of audio and text data
   - Applies conditioning dropout and perturbation
   - Handles inpainting masks and extensions
   - Normalizes inputs to proper ranges

3. Forward Pass:
   - Samples noise levels (sigmas) for diffusion
   - Adds noise to inputs based on sampled sigmas
   - Runs UNet forward pass to predict denoised data
   - Applies any input perturbations configured

4. Loss Computation:
   - Calculates denoising loss across sampled sigmas
   - Weights losses based on noise levels
   - Tracks metrics in loss buckets for analysis
   - Handles text embedding loss if enabled

5. Optimization:
   - Accumulates gradients across micro-batches
   - Applies gradient clipping and noise
   - Updates model parameters via optimizer
   - Adjusts learning rates per schedule

6. Validation:
   - Evaluates model on validation set
   - Uses separate sigma sampling settings
   - Computes validation metrics
   - Tracks best performing checkpoints

7. Logging & Monitoring:
   - Records training metrics per batch
   - Generates validation samples
   - Exports loss curves and histograms
   - Handles early stopping if needed
